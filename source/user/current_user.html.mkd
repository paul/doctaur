You can use `/user` to get the currently logged in user. This is a shortcut to `/user/{login}` for
your particular login.

```bash
curl -u "paul:{{password}}" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/user
```

```ruby
@github = GitHub::Client.new(token)
@github.current_user
```
